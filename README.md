# Normalizing-Flow-Models


With the abundance of unlabeled and unstructured data across a multitude of disciplines, the area of unsupervised probabilistic modeling is an important concept in deep learning. Specifically, it is essential for developing generative models capable of performing sampling, inference and reconstruction tasks. Normalizing flow-based generative models revolve around developing tractable probability distributions that map high dimensional samples to latent representations through unsupervised learning. In this project, two flow models theorized in literature are implemented and evaluated in Pytorch utilizing the MNIST dataset.
